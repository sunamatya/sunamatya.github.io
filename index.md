## Research:
My research lies in modeling human-like behavior in human-robot interaction. Much of my research is about inferring the intent in interaction. 
My most recent work focuses on autonomous vehicles. Representative papers are highlighted.

## News:
*	Our paper titled "Research Needs in Human-Autonomy Teaming: Thematic Analysis of Priority Features for Testbed Development" has been selected in RO-MAN 2024 happening on August 26-30 in Pasadena, California
*	I will be showing some of our work at Open Door 2024 at RISE Lab, Poly campus.

*	I successfully completed my Comprehensive Exam on 30th Nov 2022!!
