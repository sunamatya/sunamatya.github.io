## Research:
My research lies at modeling human like behavior in human robot interaction. Much of my research is about inferring the intent in interaction. 
My most recent work focuses on in autonomous vehicles. Representative papers are highlighted.

## News:
*	Our Paper "When Shall I Estimate Your Intent? Costs and Benefits of Intent Inference in Multi-Agent Interactions", got accepted for ACC 2022!
*	[I was at the ASU Day at the Capitol showcasing some of the work from RISE Lab] (https://twitter.com/asuriselab/status/1486181046613774337/photo/2)
